                <p>
                    What is wisdom?
                    I believe wisdom is knowing the right move. It's about knowing when to act and when not to act,
                    knowing when to speak and when to listen, when to attend and when to ignore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How would you know when to act?
                    You need to see the possible consequences of your actions and inactions.
                    In my opinion, here lies the difference between being smart and being wise.
                    A smart person can see short-term consequences, whereas a wise person can see long-term consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's assume long-term is the future, where you cannot easily see, given your presence.
                    For me, long-term would be 2-3 years.
                    How can I make an optimal move to maximize my 2028 success?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I realize that's why older people seem wiser. It's not because they can see long-term consequences.
                    But because they have lived them. They know what would happen in your 30s if you do this and that in your 20s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is common wisdom one can follow and be guaranteed a good life.
                    But it may not be enough for what you want to achieve if you are more ambitious than normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, you may be forced to follow your intuitions that may not seem wise.
                    But isn't that what makes life interesting? For some actions or inactions, you cannot see the long-term consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, wisdom is also when to be wise and when not to be wise?
