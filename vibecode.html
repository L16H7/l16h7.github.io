                <h1>I am in love with vibecoding</h1>
                <div class="article-meta">Apr 29, 2025</div>
                <p>Why do we code? For me, I love solving problems and it just happens that solving problems with code
                    pays money.</p>
                <p>
                    I see "vibecoding" as an expression of your imagination rather than solving software
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been using v0dev to vibecode the entire frontend for a week and it's been going well.
                    I never enjoy centering a div and making the app beautiful. I am bad at it and don't want to work
                    on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe vibecoding will solve more problems in most tech-related jobs and create
                    problems as well. e.g., refactoring the mess I vibecoded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not believe AI will solve all the problems because we, humans, are going to create more complex
                    problems.
                    That's what we have done since the dawn of humanity. :3
                </p>
                <p>
                    If AI can solve trivial problems, that will give us time to work on complex problems.
                    That's the future I see, the future where AI asks for help, not the other way around.
