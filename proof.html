            Enjoying proofs is like hearing the music of mathematics. As an engineer who's been away from maths for some time, I believe proofs are the best way to return to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading proofs and learning how to prove may not yield immediate results.  Rather, it's about preparing the mind - like preparing soil before planting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step is to get the mindset right. Mastering proofs will make things easier to learn.
            In my opinion, it's the most effective way to develop the mathematical intuition.

            I wholeheartedly endorse this book. Proofs: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook.
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Proofs-Long-Form-Mathematics-Textbook-Math/dp/B08T8JCVF1/">Amazon</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is beginner-friendly and exercises offer the right amount of challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Happy Ï€ day!!
