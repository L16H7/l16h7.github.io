    <h2>Proofs: Can you hear the music?</h2>
    <img src="proof.jpg" width="150" />
    <p>
        Enjoying proofs is like hearing the music of mathematics. As an engineer who's been away from maths for some time, I believe proofs are the best way to return to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reading proofs and learning how to prove may not yield immediate results.  Rather, it's about preparing the mind - like preparing soil before planting.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step is to get the mindset right. Mastering proofs will make things easier to learn.
        In my opinion, it's the most effective way to develop the mathematical intuition.

        I wholeheartedly endorse this book. Proofs: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook.
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Proofs-Long-Form-Mathematics-Textbook-Math/dp/B08T8JCVF1/">Amazon</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is beginner-friendly and exercises offer the right amount of challenge.
    </p>
