          In high school, I wondered why only the ancient Greeks seemed to study mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wondered why my ancestors, ancient Burmese, were not doing math.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading the history of mathematics, I realize that people from all over the world did the math.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematics is a universal human endeavor. It cannot be attributed to a single civilization or culture.
          With that said, the author notes that geography and culture shape mathematical progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just want to use the quote from the book:
          <em>"Trading with people forced them to break out of their bubble, see other ways one can live, meet new
            people and exchange ideas."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Regions active in trade were likelier to advance mathematics.
          Cultures that welcomed open debate and diverse thought were crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talent is universal but opportunities are not.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I owe my ancestors an apology for assuming they did not study mathematics.
          I was dumb.
          There must be people pursuing mathematics but they might get ridiculed or not recognized.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly recommend this book. I hope it will open your eyes like it did for me.
